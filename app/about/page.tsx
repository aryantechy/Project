        <h1 className='    font-semibold text-yellow-100'> A gas safety system is designed to ensure the safe and efficient use of gas in various settings. It typically consists of several components, including gas detectors, gas shut-off valves, and ventilation systems. Gas detectors are installed to detect any leaks or abnormal levels of gas, triggering an alarm or alert to notify occupants of potential dangers. Gas shut-off valves automatically shut off the gas supply in the event of a leak or other hazardous situations. Ventilation systems help to maintain a healthy and safe environment by effectively dissipating any accumulated gas. Implementing a comprehensive gas safety system is crucial to prevent accidents, protect lives, and minimize the risks associated with gas use. </h1>
